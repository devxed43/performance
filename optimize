Image Optimization Notes:

# Performance

🚨 Amazon calculated that if a page load slows down by 1 second, that could cost $1.6B that year

⚡️ Process:
client  ↔ server
- get req to server
- server res w/ html file
- browser reads html file
    - reqs stylesheet
    - reqs image
    - reqs script

⚡️ visitors expect site to load in within 2 seconds
- 50% of visitors will leave if it takes more than 3 seconds

⚡️ 3 Keys to Performance
🚨 *there are infinite ways to optimize*
1. number of requests → avg website makes 100 requests
2. network latency → time per file transfer
3. backend processing → time to load data from database, assemble xyz

⚡️ 3 Major Keys to Optimization:
1. Critical Render Path
2. File Transfer
3. Backend Tweaks(load balancing, CDN, DB Scaling, GZIP, etc)

🤖 Framework Benefits:
- Next.js
    - built in file shrinkage
    - built in image optimization
    - folder-based routing
    - default server side rendering(faster delivery)
    - removes exif image data for privacy → https://www.verexif.com/en/

⚡️ Network Performance:
- shrink files
    - minimize html, css, js(remove spaces)
        - webpack
        - minify
- optimize images
    - JPG:
        - big in size
        - photographs w/ many colors
        - don’t allow transparency
    - GIF:
        - grainy due to reduced color count
    - PNG:
        - limit number of colors used
        - smaller in size than JPG
        - used as LOGO’s
        - transparent backgrounds
    - SVG(Vector Graphics)
        - image stays sharp no matter how much you expend them
        - small size
        - used for retina, 4K display
        - can customize them with CSS
        - tend to be simple visuals with a few colors(not complex)

⚡️ Optimizing Images Ourselves:
🌀 jpeg optimizer → https://jpeg-optimizer.com/
    13.2MB(too big) → 13.5KB(99% smaller)
🌀 png optimizer → https://tinypng.com/
    3.8MB → 1.1MB
🌀 preview app → allows file size changing

tips:
If CSS says an image is 500px, resize the image to be 500px
larger the resolution ⇒ larger file size

⚡️ media queries for different screen sizes
- at different screen sizes, we can load in different images + other resources
- a media query that affects a min-width of 900px says all screen sizes that are 900px and bigger, display one layout
- a media query that affects width 500px, it means display another layout for screen sizes from 0 all the way up to 500px
