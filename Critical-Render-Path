learned about how the critical render path works:

DOM → CSSOM → RENDER TREE → LAYOUT → PAINT → EVENTS → AFFECT RENDER TREE → CREATE NEW LAYOUT → NEW PAINT(RESULT)

Browser reads the html file and creates the Document Object Model
Browser runs into the css file, reads it and creates the CSS Object Model
Browser runs into the javascript file, reads it, and creates a Render Tree
Render tree is a combination of Document Object Model and CSS Object Model
From here the layout is figured out
Once layout is figured out
Website/App paints that blueprint
Event Listeners, affect the javascript render tree, 
  a new layout is registered,
  a new painted website/app is built.
